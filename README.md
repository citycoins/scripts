# CityCoins Scripts

> NOTE: This repository is being updated to use TypeScript, micro-stacks and the CityCoins API.
> 
> More information will be added/updated over time.

This directory provides TypeScript examples of how to interact with the Stacks blockchain and CityCoins protocol.

All of the scripts use [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to gather the required information, and nothing is stored on disk.

For scripts that use a private key, remember to **keep it safe** and **never share with anyone**. [This page has more information](./privatekey.md) on how to obtain your hex encoded private key for scripts that require it.
