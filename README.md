# CityCoins Scripts

This directory provides TypeScript examples of how to interact with the [Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.co) and [CityCoins protocol](https://citycoins.co).

All of the scripts use [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to gather the required information, and nothing is stored on disk.

For scripts that use a private key, remember to **keep it safe** and **never share with anyone**.

[This page has more information](./privatekey.md) on how to obtain your hex encoded private key for scripts that require it.

## Requirements

- [Node.js / NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Mac/Linux)
